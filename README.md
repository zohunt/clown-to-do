# 🤡 Clown-Themed To-Do List

A colorful and playful to-do list project built with HTML and CSS, inspired by the colors of the clown emoji 🎈🤡 — red, blue, yellow, and white — all wrapped up in a dark theme.

This project was created as a fun way to practice semantic HTML, accessibility, link styling, and layout centering. Great for beginners and circus performers alike!
